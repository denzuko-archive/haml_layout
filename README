HAML AppLayout Generator
========================

This is a rails 2.0 generator for creating a simple haml, sass and controller 
helpers to run with initial setup of a rails app or for creating different 
layouts within existing applications.

Prerequisite
============

  * Rails 2.0 or better
  * haml 0.2 or better

Examples
========

  rails MY_PROJECT && cd MY_PROJECT
  haml --rails .
  rm -fv public/index.html

  ./script/generate haml_layout application

  This will create all the basic application and layout files, plus supporting 
  files for a new rails application.

  From this you can then edit your config/database.yml and build your schema,
  and controllers. Then setting your default route in config/routes.rb and
  launch the server.
