Description:
    The app_layout generator creates a basic SASS stylesheet and HAML layout
    file which will give some structure to a starting Rails app.

    The generator takes in only one argument that of the layout and stylesheet 
    file name.

    It then checks for haml in the vender/plugins, and creates the supporting
    files. Besure to taylor these files to your application's needs.

Examples:
    ./script/generate haml_layout application

        This will create three files and one directory:
            Helper:     app/helper/application_helper.rb
            Layout:     app/views/layouts/application.html.rb
            Directory:  public/stylesheets/sass
            Stylesheet: public/stylesheets/sass/application.css
